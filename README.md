# Elevator-Control-System
## Abstract
This abstract presents an elevator control system utilizing a cascaded Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to manage the position and velocity of a DC motor. The system ensures precise and smooth elevator movement, enhancing user comfort and safety.
The position PID controller determines the elevator car's accurate positioning by comparing the desired and actual positions, minimizing steady-state errors and abrupt changes. The velocity PID controller regulates motor speed by maintaining the desired velocity while damping oscillations and reducing overshoot. Together, these controllers enable smooth and efficient motion.
By implementing cascaded PID control, the system achieves reliable performance, accurate floor positioning, and a comfortable ride with minimal errors and reduced jerky movements.

## Objectives
1. To explain the concept of a PID controller.
2. Design an Elevator using Autodesk Inventor.
3. Design, test and implement a cascaded PID controller for an elevator system to control its position and velocity.

## Background Theory
Elevators, also known as lifts, are vertical transportation systems designed to transport people or goods between different floors or levels of a building. Elevators play a crucial role in modern architecture and have become an integral part of high-rise buildings, commercial complexes, residential towers, and other structures. The operation and control of elevators involve various engineering principles and technologies to ensure safe, efficient, and reliable transportation.
### Basic Elevator Components:
An elevator system consists of several key components:
1. Cab/Car: The elevator car is the enclosed platform that carries passengers or goods. It moves vertically along guide rails, providing transportation between different floors.
2. Hoistway/Shaft: The hoistway, also called the elevator shaft, is the vertical space in which the elevator car travels. It is constructed with sturdy walls and contains the guide rails, counterweights, and other essential components.
3. Counterweights: Counterweights are designed to offset the weight of the elevator car and its occupants. They help reduce the overall energy required for vertical movement and enhance the system's efficiency.
4. Traction System or Hydraulic System: Elevators typically employ either a traction system or a hydraulic system for vertical motion. The traction system uses ropes or belts connected to an electric motor, whereas the hydraulic system relies on hydraulic fluid and a piston arrangement to move the elevator car.
5. Control System: The control system manages the operation of the elevator, including starting, stopping, and speed regulation. It monitors various sensors, processes user inputs, and ensures the safety and smooth functioning of the elevator.
